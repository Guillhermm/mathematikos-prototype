# Prototype Mathematikos

**Mathematikos** is an educational and playful game that takes players on a journey through time, exploring the great civilizations of antiquity by solving numerical challenges and learning about their unique number systems. This initial prototype focuses on providing an engaging experience with addition and subtraction operations using numbers from the Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, Roman, and Chinese systems.

## Objective

The objective of *Mathematikos* is to teach players about the different number systems used by ancient civilizations in a fun way, challenging them to solve mathematical problems in various historical scenarios. Players travel through time and help fictional characters by solving numerical puzzles that protect the mathematical legacy of these cultures.

## Civilizations and Number Systems

The game involves five number systems from different ancient civilizations, ordered from easiest to hardest:

1. **Romans (Easy)**
   - Base 10 system with simple numerals (I, V, X, L, C, D, M).
   - The initial difficulty lies in adding and subtracting repeated symbols.

2. **Egyptians (Intermediate)**
   - Base 10 system, but with a larger number of symbols for different powers of ten.
   - Visual challenge, as players need to identify and sum various graphical symbols.

3. **Greeks (Intermediate)**
   - Base 10 system with alphabetic symbols.
   - The complexity lies in distinguishing numerical symbols from Greek letters and understanding some grouping rules.

4. **Babylonians (Advanced)**
   - Base 60 (sexagesimal) system.
   - Difficulty in performing operations with multiples of 60 and associating the correct values with their symbols.

5. **Chinese (Advanced)**
   - Decimal system based on counting rods or the use of an abacus.
   - Complexity in the different representations of numbers and the need to think in a vertical notation to perform calculations.

## Game Variations

*Mathematikos* will be developed in two main versions, each with a distinct narrative style, challenges, and gameplay mechanics:

### 1. Variation "Thematic Scenes"
